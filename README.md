### Hi I'm Yurley SolimerðŸ‘‹

I'm a Systems Engineer with a focus on web development. I have developed many projects in college and in the work environment, I have been freelancing for more than four years, I'm also co-founder of We Grow, a software agency. Thanks to this experience, I have strong Front-end and Back-end knowledge.

With Back-end, my strongest area is database design, implementation and management.

I have solid knowledge of the MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express, React and Node JS).
