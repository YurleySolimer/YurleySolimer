### Hi I'm Yurley SolimerðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Yurley Solimer. I'm a Systems Engineer focused on develop digital products with over 5+ years of experience in a wide range of disciplines: manager, leader, entrepreneur, web developer, analyst, testing, and more.

Since beginning my journey as a freelance, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use.

I actively participate in the continuous improvement of software development processes through automated testing and QA solutions, code reviews, documentation and software architecture design.

I like to keep learning, continue challenging myself and do interesting things to create a best world.
